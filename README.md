##Overview

Desert Storm is a top-down perspective tank vs. tank shooter. The player controls a M1 Abrams tank. The objective is to shoot and eliminate all enemy T-72 tanks. The enemy tanks are ranked by colors which represent their health points(HP). The sand colored tanks have the highest HP followed by red tanks. The green tanks are easy to spot and have the lowest HP. After eliminating all tanks from the map the level advances with more tank spawn the previous level. Sometimes eliminated tanks spawn power-up packs which increase the attribute of the player tank permanently. The attributes of the player are gun damage, firing rate, speed, and armor level.


##Controls

The turret of the tank is controlled by the mouse. The gun is aimed toward to direction of the mouse with respect to the center of the tank turret. The `w` key advances the tank to a faster gear and the `w` key drops the tank to a lower gear. Dropping the gear level below neutral will put the tank in reverse. The `a` and `d` keys rotate the tank with respect to its body's central axis. Left mouse click controls the firing of the turret gun.

The gun has a reload time. The square on the bottom left of the screen shows green when the gun is ready to shoot and red when it is in reload mode.

The health of the player tank is shown on the bottom left. The game is over when the health of the player is below 0.
